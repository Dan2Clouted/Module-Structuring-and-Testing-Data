// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

// The error is that the variable cityOfBirth is being used before it is declared and assigned a value. To fix this, the declaration should be before the console.log statement.
