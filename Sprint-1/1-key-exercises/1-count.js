let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//The right-hand side count + 1 is evaluated first to produce the value 1, then = assigns that results to count and overwrites the previous value of 0.
// The one-term  word for this is increment. Because we are adding 1 to the count variable.
